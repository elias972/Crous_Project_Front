## Overview

Crous_Project_Front is an Android application designed to display and manage data about Crous restaurants or facilities. Users can view Crous details in a list, mark certain establishments as favorites, visualize their locations on a map, and even add new Crous items using a built-in form. The app interfaces with a remote server using a RESTful API, handles pagination in the listing screen, and provides a user-friendly UI with tabs and bottom navigation.

**Key Features:**
- **List of Crous:** Displays a paginated list of restaurants/facilities fetched from a remote server.
- **Favorites:** Mark/unmark any Crous as a favorite for quick access.
- **Map Integration:** Visualize all available Crous locations directly on a Google Map.
- **Add New Crous:** Use a dedicated form to add new Crous entries to the server.
- **Info Tab:** An informational tab to present static or dynamic content relevant to the application.
